# Mathematical Formula for Pollution Reduction Solver
# A set M = {m1, m2, ..., mn} containing n mitigation projects (this varies depending on the user)
# A set P = {p1, p2, ..., pm} containing m pollutants to be reduced. (doesn't change, consistent)

# Parameters:
# cost - 1 <= i <= n (meaning that the cost of the mitigation project must be greater than 1 but less than n, where n is the mitigation projects)
# xi - 1 <= i <= n (unknown number of mitigation project mi must be implemented)
